# RTL Free Tools
## 1) AMD Vivado ML Stadard Edition v2025.1 (Recommended)
AMD Vivado ML Standard Edition v2025.1 is a popular free tool that provides a comprehensive set of capabilities for designing, implementing and verifying Register-Transfer Level (RTL) designs targeting a specific subset of AMD's FPGA and Adaptive SoC devices. While it's the free edition and has device limitations, its core RTL design features are quite robust that are comparable to commercial simulators.
### Here's a breakdown of its RTL Design capabilities:
### 1) RTL Design entry and management
#### HDL Support
It fully supports industry-standard Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) such as Verilog and VHDL for creating your RTL source files.
#### Project and Non-Project Modes
You can work within the Vivado Integrated Design Environment (IDE) in either Project Mode (for a guided, push-button flow) or Non-Project Mode (for Tcl-script based, highly customizable workflows).
#### IP Integrator
Vivado IP Integrator allows for graphical and Tcl-based design development, enabling plug-and-play IP integration and rapid assembly of complex systems using AMD's IP catalog, your own custom IP, or IP from other sources.
#### Hierarchical Design
Vivado facilitates hierarchical design, allowing you to manage complex designs by breaking them down into smaller and manageable modules which can be synthesized out of context (OOC) for efficiency.
### 2) Simulation
The built-in Vivado Simulator allows for behavioral and structural logic simulation, supporting mixed-language simulation (Verilog and VHDL).
### 3) Tcl scripting and automation
All design flows and analysis features can be accessed and controlled via Tcl commands, either interactively in the Tcl console or through scripting for automation, enabling scripting for automation and customization of the design flow.
### 4) Limited Device Support:
The main distinction of the Standard Edition is its limited device support, typically including a subset of AMD's FPGA and Adaptive SoC families. According to AMD's support documentation, aside from device support, there are generally no feature differences between the Standard and Enterprise editions.
# RTL Open-Source Tools
## 1) Icarus Verilog v12.0
Icarus Verilog is a popular open-source tool that serves as both a compiler and a simulator for the Verilog Hardware Description Language. It's a free and widely used alternative to commercial simulators.
### Here's a breakdown of its key aspects:
### 1) Compiler
Icarus Verilog compiles Verilog source code, including support for the 1995, 2001 and 2005 versions of the IEEE 1364 Verilog standard and some extensions, into a target format for simulation or other processing. It also generates netlists for synthesis purposes.
### 2) Simulator
The compiler generates an intermediate format (vvp assembly), which is then executed by the vvp command to simulate the design.
### 3) Synthesis
While primarily a simulator, Icarus Verilog's synthesis capabilities are improving, allowing for the generation of netlists in formats like EDIF. It supports various FPGA devices through its fpga code generator.
### 4) Waveform Viewing
While Icarus Verilog itself doesn't display waveforms, it can generate VCD (Value Change Dump) files that can be viewed with tools like GTKWave.
### 5) SystemVerilog Support
While it supports some SystemVerilog features, full SystemVerilog support is still under development, and it may not fully support advanced verification constructs like those in UVM (Universal Verification Methodology).
### 6) AMS Support
### Diagnostic Capabilities
Sometimes produces less informative or ambiguous error messages compared to commercial tools.
### Synthesis Limitations
Primarily designed for simulation, its synthesis capabilities are improving but may not be as robust or feature-rich as dedicated synthesis tools.
